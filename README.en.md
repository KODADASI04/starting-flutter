# What You will see here?

I gathered here the work I did when I started developing a mobile application with Flutter and the codes I wrote during my learning phases. Here, creating the first page in flutter, columns and rows, gridview structure, using shared preferences, creating in-app file, creating a page with scaffold structure, extracting data from database on the internet, creating tap bar, creating local database with mysql structure and you will be able to find out what are the features of stateful widgets.
